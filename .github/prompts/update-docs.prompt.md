Scan scripts and tests making sure documentation is current with the latest data of the project's code base. Also make sure the CICD pipeline is current with the state of the codebase.

**CRITICAL: NO HALLUCINATIONS ALLOWED**

- **NEVER make up URLs, file paths, or endpoints that don't exist**
- **ALWAYS verify URLs exist before including them in documentation**
- **ONLY reference actual, existing files, functions, and features**
- **If unsure about a URL or endpoint, either verify it exists or ask the user**
- **When updating contact information, use only verified, working URLs**

**Examples of prohibited behavior:**
- Creating fictional GitHub security advisory URLs
- Referencing non-existent API endpoints
- Making up file paths that don't exist in the codebase
- Inventing feature names or parameters not actually implemented
